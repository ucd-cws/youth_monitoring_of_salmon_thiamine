# Youth Monitoring of Salmon Thiamine

A citizen science project to track the impacts of potential thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency (which is an essential building block for all life) through youth classrooms. Data will be reported from each classroom weekly as students monitor how salmon eggs in tanks hatch (or not) and grow.

## Visualization & Figures

Additionally, a few summary plots of the data will be updated each week, and saved in the [`figures`](figures/) folder.
