On the swimming question, I wasn't sure how to answer for this stage of their life.   8 are sitting upright on the gravel, and another is on it's side.  It's probably dead, but I'll check in the morning to verify.",NA

Edward Harris Jr. MS,2021-12-29T15:00:00Z,2021-12-29,60,"Water is clear, pump functioning well",30,22,1,0,7,13,"Actual water temp is 62.  As they become more active, I'm beginning to question the way I was previously reporting my data.  Of the 28 fish that are still alive, 1 is laying on it's side in the gravel.  5 are sitting upright in the gravel, but not swimming, and the remaining 22 are actively swimming around the tank.  
Should there be a question in the form that says something like, ""how many fish have hatched, and sitting on the gravel but not actively swimming?"", as a way to differentiate between those two stages?  Or do I only report the ones ""swimming up"" as the ones who have moved out of the gravel?  If that's the case, my data needs to be revised.","The surviving fish are not fully buttoned up yet.  If new eggs are being delivered next week, I will need to let these fish go in the next couple days.  Is that ok?  Or should I hold on to them until they are a little larger, and pass on the new eggs?"
