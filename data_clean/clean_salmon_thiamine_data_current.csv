Should there be a question in the form that says something like, ""how many fish have hatched, and sitting on the gravel but not actively swimming?"", as a way to differentiate between those two stages?  Or do I only report the ones ""swimming up"" as the ones who have moved out of the gravel?  If that's the case, my data needs to be revised.","The surviving fish are not fully buttoned up yet.  If new eggs are being delivered next week, I will need to let these fish go in the next couple days.  Is that ok?  Or should I hold on to them until they are a little larger, and pass on the new eggs?"

About half of the fish wedged themselves behind the tube that lead to the chiller because of a shallow dip in the pebbles there. Fish were gently moved and the hole was filled in. It was noticed that the fish in tank 6 seem to have more yolk still than those from tank 5 and this may be due to them piling up in the corner with each other for an extended period of time.,NA
